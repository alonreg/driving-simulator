2.	Solve simple math problems – as many as possible.

export const instructions_body_2 = `This vehicle is autonomous. However, It may need some human assistance when reaching an obstacle. 
You can assist the vehicle by choosing one of the directions, in which you think the vehicle has a good chance of passing successfully. If you think there’s a low chance of passing successfully, you can instead call for a rescue. 
A successful pass will gain you points. A failed pass will subtract point. A rescue will also subtract points, but less than a failed pass. Try to collect as many points as you can.
Here is the driving console:
`;

export const instructions_body_3 = `Each direction has some info displayed above it.
The percentage number represents what the vehicle’s algorithm suggests is the chance of failing to pass the obstacle. A bigger percentage is tougher to pass, a smaller percentage is easier to pass.
The bar beneath it, represents how tough the obstacles looks to you, through the vehicle’s cameras. A bigger bar is tougher to pass. A smaller bar is easier to pass.
The Rescue option calls for a rescue, ensuring you will pass. However, it will subtract you points (but less than failing to pass).
Here is an example where the vehicle suggests there’s 0% chance to fail when choosing the right direction. However, in your perception, it looks like there’s a somewhat bigger chance to fail (because the bar is about 15% full, meaning there’s about 15% chance to fail in your perception).
`;
export const instructions_body_4 = `You can choose between 2 modes – Manual, and Autonomous. 
Manual will enable you to decide the direction on your own, based on your perception of the obstacle, and the vehicle’s algorithm assessment.
Autonomous will let the vehicle decide the best course, based on its algorithm solely.
You can change modes only when the vehicle is driving.
Here is the mode switch:

export const instructions_body_5 = `On the top-left of the screen you’ll be able to see the scoreboard, which will show you your current score. Bellow it you’ll see the scoring details. 
Here is an example, although your score details might be different.
Successful – passing the obstacles successfully.
Passing – whenever you choose to go right or left, your point will be subtracted. Going forward won’t subtract point. (For example, you might go in the left direction, and succeed. You will receive points for your success, but you will lose point for going left. On the contrary, you may choose to go forward, but fail. You will lose points for failing, but you won’t lose points for passing right or left).
Stuck - failing to pass an obstacle successfully. 
Rescue – calling for a rescue. This ensures you won’t fail, but you will still lose some points.
Calculation – when you make a correct calculation.
Here is an example of a scoreboard.
