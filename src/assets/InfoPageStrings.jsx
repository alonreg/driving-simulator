The larger the blue area is - the higher the chance to hit the obstacle, and lose points. \n In this example, the AutoAssist suggests a 5% chance to hit the obstacle when choosing this direction. \nHowever, the human vision (the blue area) suggests almost 50% chance \n Remember - You want to avoid hitting the obstacles.
